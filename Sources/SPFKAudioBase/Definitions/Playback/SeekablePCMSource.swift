/// a file and is emphatically not safe to drive from two places at once, so it is expected to be
/// `@unchecked Sendable` with that invariant stated. What the conformance buys is that a player can
/// hand one to a feed `Task` - the alternative being a serial dispatch queue, which is the GCD this
/// codebase has otherwise removed.
